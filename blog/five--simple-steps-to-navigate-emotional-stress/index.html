<p>Over the course of my 20-something years in performance and teaching, I have experienced stress quite frequently. In some ways, I’ve learned how to stave off stress, and I’ve been able to accomplish an enormous amount when life gets overwhelmingly busy. I’ve come to distinguish between stress caused by emotional, mental, social, and physical factors. Sometimes I could identify the source, but often there were multiple contributors intertwined. There were probably two points in my life when I came close to breaking and giving up entirely.</p>
<p>The first was while I was working toward my doctoral defense. I seriously considered quitting music, dropping out of my degree program, and switching to project management—just getting a steady job and raising my kids. Miraculously, I made it through. I graduated and was honored with the Dean’s Scholarship Award for my lecture recital document.
The second time was about two years ago when my mom was in and out of the hospital, suffering from excruciating pain. The doctors had no answers, and I felt completely helpless to ease her suffering or find a treatment. In both instances, emotional and mental stress took a severe toll and manifested physically. The lack of sleep, the worry, the guilt, and the overwhelming feeling of having no control—it was almost unbearable.</p>
<p>During the first year of my doctoral program, I was cast in a mainstage production as one of the lead characters. When I found out I was pregnant, physical stress became a huge factor. I was commuting daily from Herndon to Winchester, caring for two young children, juggling a full-time academic schedule, and teaching students. That physical strain was understandable. But the emotional and mental stress came from the uncomfortable conversations I had to initiate—with the conductor, the stage director, and the costume department. It’s not every day you see a pregnant opera singer on stage. I had to communicate to the costume designer that we would need to leave extra room in my dress, as my body would keep changing. Once I gathered the courage to talk to her, she responded with incredible sensitivity and understanding.</p>
<h2 id="emotional-awareness-the-key-to-management">Emotional Awareness: The Key to Management</h2>
<p>Over time, I’ve come to understand that the way I manage emotions—in myself and in my relationships—deeply influences my productivity, performance, and how I see the world. Emotions are rich sources of information, reflecting how we respond to our circumstances. My emotional state—whether it’s frustration, overwhelm, excitement, or inspiration—shapes my thoughts, which in turn dictate my actions. When I have the emotional awareness and control to choose my response instead of simply reacting, I feel more in alignment with my purpose and more empowered in my daily life. Choosing your response is a powerful way to live.</p>
<h2 id="stress-as-a-barometer">Stress as a Barometer</h2>
<p>Rather than letting stress hijack our emotions, we can use our emotional state as a barometer.
For example: If you notice anxiety or fear becoming overwhelming, instead of lashing out at those around you, you can choose to take a walk or go for a run to lower cortisol and adrenaline. Engaging in activities that release endorphins—like cuddling with a pet—can help you refocus and regain emotional balance. Awareness and emotional management are essential to staying engaged and creating a life of purpose and success.</p>
<h2 id="6-simple-steps-to-navigate-emotional-stress">6 Simple Steps to Navigate Emotional Stress</h2>
<p>Here are a few simple but powerful steps to help navigate emotionally stressful situations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Recognize what emotions are coming up and acknowledge and validate those emotions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explore what those emotions may be revealing about an important issue, need, or personal value. Try to reframe your interpretation of the stressful situation. Try to understand other perspectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To respond consciously, clarify the situation. Take a few deep breaths or go for a walk to create distance and a fresh view.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engage in uplifting activities, choose something that boosts endorphins, like exercising or spending time with a pet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reach out, connect with friends or family, and if needed, seek the support of a therapist or life coach.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Stress is a part of life, but how we manage our emotional response can make all the difference.</p> </div> <!-- Author bio --> <div class="mt-12 pt-8 border-t border-gray-200"> <div class="flex items-start gap-4"> <div class="flex-1"> <p class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-1">Dr. Alina Kirshon-Goldman</p> <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">
