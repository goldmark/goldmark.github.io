<p>For the past few weeks I have been listening to James Clear’s Atomic Habits. Listening to the book, I gained a deeper understanding of my role as a LIfe Energy Coach. Previously, I believed that setting a goal and crafting a plan were sufficient for success. Clear presents a compelling argument that setting goals alone isn’t enough. According to him, to enact real, lasting change, we must focus on who we want to become and develop a system of small, consistent habits aligned with that identity. He emphasizes that true, lasting change stems from focusing on who you want to become, not just what you want to achieve.​ Clear introduces three layers of behavior change: outcomes (what you get), processes (what you do), and identity (what you believe). While most people concentrate on outcomes, Clear emphasizes that true change stems from identity. He states, “The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity” . He introduces the concept of identity-based habits, suggesting that our behaviors are a reflection of our identity. To change our habits, we must first change our beliefs about ourselves. This means aligning our daily actions with the person we aspire to be. Each small habit becomes a vote for this new identity.​</p>
<h2 id="three-layers-of-behavior-change-outcomes-processes-and-identity">Three layers of behavior change: outcomes, processes, and identity</h2>
<p>James Clear outlines three layers of behavior change: outcomes (what you get), processes (what you do), and identity (what you believe). While goals focus on outcomes, and systems focus on processes, the most profound changes occur at the identity level. By shifting our self-image and beliefs, we create a foundation for sustainable habits.​
This concept resonates with the principles of The Core Energy Coaching™ process, which helps people tap into their inner purpose and passion, and connects that with outer goals and tasks to bring about extraordinary and sustainable results. One of the foundation principles of Core Energy Leadership Coaching is we are each a product of our own belief system. Another foundation principle, “Each moment describes who you are and gives you the opportunity to decide if that’s who you want to be” suggests that every moment defines who we are, but not who we will be. Our past experiences can create limiting beliefs, but by becoming aware of these beliefs and making conscious choices, we can redefine our identity and shape our future.​ corporation. It helps people tap into their inner purpose and passion, and connect that with outer goals and tasks to bring about extraordinary and sustainable results. Based on the belief that true, positive change starts from within. While habits can help achieve external goals like saving money or losing weight, they also play a crucial role in shaping who we are. Becoming the best version of ourselves requires continuous reflection, belief editing, and identity expansion. In essence, becoming the best version of ourselves requires continuous reflection and adaptation of our beliefs. By focusing on identity-based habits, we not only achieve our goals but also transform into the individuals we aspire to be.</p>
<h2 id="what-habits-i-have-changed">What habits I have changed</h2>
<p>Some examples of habits I changed, or new habits that I established are very personal. Years ago in college I used to smoke. This is probably a revelation for people who know me now. One day I thought that being a singer is more important to me than being a smoker and I quit. I lapsed back into smoking twice, but because it didn’t match my identity as a professional opera singer, I had my last cigarette more than 20 years ago. Another example is one of my values is to age gracefully, which includes regular exercise and a healthy lifestyle. While I was not successful in losing weight, which was my initial goal,I developed more strength and stamina than I had in my twenties. I haven’t skipped a week of exercise since November 2022 when I started Crossfit.</p> </div> <!-- Author bio --> <div class="mt-12 pt-8 border-t border-gray-200"> <div class="flex items-start gap-4"> <div class="flex-1"> <p class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-1">Dr. Alina Kirshon-Goldman</p> <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">
